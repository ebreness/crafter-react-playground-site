# If you're using the  Crafter CMS's Preview Proxy to view the dev mode app inside Preview,
# configuring the port makes hot reload work inside the Crafter CMS Preview Frame (otherwise
# the hot reload port is found by window.location.port, which will result in Crafter's port,
# which is 8080).  If you use any other port to run your webpack dev server, you should
# adjust this to that port too.
